"""Print one version's section of CHANGELOG.md, for use as release notes.

    python .github/scripts/changelog_section.py 26.9.0

Prints the body of the `## [26.9.0]` section — everything after its heading, up to but not including
the next `## ` heading — with the changelog's link-reference definitions appended so that any
reference inside the body still resolves. Exits non-zero, with a message naming what it looked for,
if the section is not there.

WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN `gh release create --generate-notes`. Generated notes are built from the
merge history: pull-request titles, contributor handles, a "New Contributors" block. On this
repository that produces a release page that says nothing about the release — the user-facing
content is entirely in this changelog — and that quotes internal wording out of pull-request bodies
onto a public page. The changelog is written for the reader of the release; the merge history is not.

Failing loudly matters more than it looks. A release whose notes came out empty is not something
anyone notices until someone reads the page, by which time the tag exists and the package is
published. So an empty or missing section is an error, not a blank file.
